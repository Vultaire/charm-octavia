  Octavia is an open source, operator-scale load balancing solution designed to
  work with OpenStack.
  .
  Octavia was borne out of the Neutron LBaaS project.  Starting with the
  Liberty release of OpenStack, Octavia has become the reference implementation
  for Neutron LBaaS version 2.
  .
  Octavia accomplishes its delivery of load balancing services by managing a
  fleet of virtual machines, containers, or bare metal servers collectively
  known as amphorae which it spins up on demand. This on-demand, horizontal
  scaling feature differentiates Octavia from other load balancing solutions,
  thereby making Octavia truly suited "for the cloud."
