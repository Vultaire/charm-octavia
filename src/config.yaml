      Supported values are 'SINGLE' and 'ACTIVE_STANDBY'.
  lb-mgmt-issuing-cacert:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Certificate Authority Certificate used to issue new certificates stored
      on the ``Amphora`` load balancer instances.  The ``Amphorae`` use them to
      authenticate themselves to the ``Octavia`` controller services.
      .
      Note due to security concerns it is important not use the same CA
      certificate for both ``lb-mgmt-issuing-cacert`` and
      ``lb-mgmt-controller-cacert`` configuration options.  Failing to keep
      them separate may lead to abuse of certificate data to gain access to
      other ``Amphora`` instances in the event one of them is compromised.
      .
      Note that these certificates are not used for any load balancer payload
      data.
  lb-mgmt-issuing-ca-private-key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Private key for the Certificate Authority set in ``lb-mgmt-issuing-ca``.
      .
      Note that these certificates are not used for any load balancer payload
      data.

    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Passphrase for the key set in ``lb-mgmt-ca-private-key``.
      .
      NOTE: As of this writing Octavia requires the private key to be protected
      with a passphrase.
      .
      Note that these certificates are not used for any load balancer payload
      data.
  lb-mgmt-controller-cacert:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Certificate Authority Certificate installed on ``Amphorae`` with the
      purpose of the ``Amphora`` agent using it to authenticate connections
      from ``Octavia`` controller services.
      .
      Note due to security concerns it is important not use the same CA
      certificate for both ``lb-mgmt-issuing-cacert`` and
      ``lb-mgmt-controller-cacert`` configuration options.  Failing to keep
      them separate may lead to abuse of certificate data to gain access to
